I graduated from [the Bioinformatics Institute](https://bioinf.me/en) "Bioinformatics for biologists" program in 2022. 
- My project: [Age in gene regulatory networks](https://github.com/Freddsle/age_patterns). 
We explored if gene interaction preference for genes with similar age holds in GRNs).

During studying, I did several projects:
- [Vagus](https://github.com/Freddsle/Vagus) â€” FASTQC-like FASTQ quality analyzer tool (Python)
- [ML Telegram Bot for Blindness Detection](https://github.com/Freddsle/ML_Blindness_Detection) (Python)
- Practice with principal component analysis and linear models for differential protein expression (R). [Link](https://github.com/Freddsle/BI_Stat_2021/tree/main/mouse_project).

Also, I have experience in molecular biology and protein engineering.
